| [Chat with your data - Solution accelerator](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/chat-with-your-data-solution-accelerator). The Chat with your data Solution accelerator is a powerful tool that combines the capabilities of Azure AI Search and Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a conversational search experience. This solution accelerator uses an Azure OpenAI GPT model and an Azure AI Search index generated from your data, which is integrated into a web application to provide a natural language interface, including speech-to-text functionality, for search queries. Users can drag and drop files, point to storage, and take care of technical setup to transform documents | chat with company documents, RAG, conversational chat, vector search | Python, Langchain, AppService, Functions, Azure AI Search, Azure AI Speech, Document Intelligence |
| [Chat Copilot Sample Application](https://github.com/microsoft/chat-copilot). This sample demonstrates how Semantic Kernel and AI can be utilized in web applications by creating an integrated large language model (LLM) chat copilot. The main components of this setup include a frontend application built with React, a backend REST API service developed using .NET, and a .NET worker service responsible for processing semantic memory. | chat with company documents, RAG, statefull chat, vector search, document processing pipeline | C#, Semantic Kernel, Kernel Memory, AppService, CosmosDB, Azure AI Search,Document Intelligence, Speech Service |
| [Build a Copilot App using Azure CosmosDB-NOSQL, Azure OpenAI and Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/AzureCosmosDB/cosmosdb-nosql-copilot). This sample application provides practical guidance on building a multi-tenant, multi-user Generative-AI RAG Pattern application using Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL, leveraging its new vector database capabilities along with full-text and hybrid search using Azure OpenAI Service and Semantic Kernel. It covers essential concepts such as developing a scalable RAG Pattern application, generating embeddings and completions, managing chat history for natural interactions with a large language model, handling per-request token consumption, building a semantic cache for improved performance and cost efficiency, and implementing full-text and hybrid search. Some features are implemented using Cosmos DB native SDK until Semantic Kernel can support them. | virtual agent/assistant, chat with  business data, conversational chat, statefull chat | C#, Semantic Kernel, AppService, CosmosDB |
| [Build a Copilot App using Azure CosmosDB-MongoDB, Azure OpenAI and Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/AzureCosmosDB/cosmosdb-mongo-copilot). This sample application provides practical guidance on building a Generative-AI application using Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB, leveraging its new vector search capabilities along with Azure OpenAI Service and Semantic Kernel. It covers essential concepts such as developing a scalable Generative-AI chat application, generating completions and embeddings, managing chat history for natural interactions with a large language model, handling token consumption and payload sizes, and building a semantic cache for improved performance and cost efficiency. The application also demonstrates the use of the Semantic Kernel SDK for vector search and embeddings generation. | virtual agent/assistant, chat with business data, RAG,conversational chat, statefull chat, vector search | C#, Semantic Kernel, AppService, CosmosDB-MongoVCore |
| [Vector Search & AI Assistant](https://github.com/Azure/Vector-Search-AI-Assistant/tree/cognitive-search-vector). This solution showcases the integration of Azure Cosmos DB, Azure OpenAI Service, and Azure Cognitive Search to build a vector search solution with an AI assistant interface. It includes frontend and backend components hosted on Azure Kubernetes Service and demonstrates key concepts such as managing conversational context, handling tokens, and crafting effective prompts for ChatGPT. The scenario focuses on a consumer retail "Intelligent Agent" that allows users to query vectorized product, customer, and sales order data stored in the database. | virtual agent/assistant, chat with  business data, RAG, conversational chat, statefull chat, vector search | C#,Semantic Kernel, AKS, ACA, CosmosDB, Azure AI Search |
| [Azure Chat Solution Accelerator powered by Azure OpenAI Service](https://github.com/microsoft/azurechatgpt). This repo is a solution accelerator that allows organisations to deploy a private chat tenant in their Azure Subscription, with a familiar user experience and the added capabilities of chatting over your data and files. Web application is developed using typescript/next.js for backend and radixui for web themeing and components. The web apps is hosted on App Service | chat with company documents, chat with API, RAG, statefull chat, vector search | Nodejs, Typescript, Langchain,AppService, CosmosDB, Azure AI Search, Document Intelligence |
| [GPT-RAG Solution Accelerator](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag). The RAG pattern allows businesses to leverage the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to process and generate responses based on new data, facilitating periodic updates without the need for fine-tuning. The Enterprise RAG Solution Accelerator (GPT-RAG) provides a robust architecture designed for enterprise-grade deployment, ensuring grounded responses, Zero-trust security, and Responsible AI. It guarantees availability, scalability, and auditability, making it ideal for organizations moving from exploration and proof-of-concept stages to full-scale production and minimum viable products (MVPs). | chat with company documents, RAG, personalized content generation, conversational chat, vector search, agents | Python, nodejs, Semantic Kernel, Autogen, App Service, CosmosDB, Azure AI Search, FrontDoor |
| [Multi Agents Banking Assistant with Java and Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/agent-openai-java-banking-assistant). This project is designed as a Proof of Concept (PoC) to explore the innovative realm of generative AI within the context of multi-agent architectures. By leveraging Java and Microsoft Semantic Kernel AI orchestration framework, our aim is to build a chat web app to demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of using generative AI agents to transform user experience from web clicks to natural language conversations while maximizing reuse of the existing workload data and APIs. | virtual assistant, conversational chat, tools calling, agents | Java, Semantic Kernel, ACA, Document Intelligence |
| https://github.com/MSUSAzureAccelerators/Knowledge-Mining-with-OpenAI. The purpose of this repo is to accelerate the deployment of a Python-based Knowledge Mining solution with OpenAI that will ingest a Knowledge Base, generate embeddings using the contents extracted, store them in a vector search engine (Cognitive Search), and use that engine to answer queries / questions specific to that Knowledge Base. The Cognitive Search component serves to make it easier to ingest a Knowledge Base with a variety of document formats. The Cognitive Services component connected to the Search makes it possible to have an enrichment pipeline. This pipeline can generate information based on images for example, which can be included at the time of generating embeddings. This repo also includes a guide to build a Power Virtual Agent bot that could be used and adapted to connect to this solution, to create an end-to-end Knowledge Base Chatbot. | chat with company documents, RAG, personalized content generation, conversational chat, vector search | Python, Langchain, AppService, CosmosDB, Azure Redis Cache, Azure AI Search, Document Intelligence, ServiceBus, EventGrid |
