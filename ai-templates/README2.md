        The Chat with your data Solution accelerator is a powerful tool that combines the capabilities of Azure AI Search and Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a conversational search experience. This solution accelerator uses an Azure OpenAI GPT model and an Azure AI Search index generated from your data, which is integrated into a web application to provide a natural language interface, including speech-to-text functionality, for search queries. Users can drag and drop files, point to storage, and take care of technical setup to transform documents. </td>

        The scenario for this sample centers around a consumer retail &quot;Intelligent Agent&quot; that allows users to ask questions on vectorized product, customer and sales order data stored in the database. The solution also includes key concepts such as managing conversational context and history, managing tokens consumed by Azure OpenAI Service. APIs and web application are hosted on AKS pods. Azure Cognitive Search is used as vector database.</td>

        <td>https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag. The RAG pattern enables businesses to use the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, using their existing models to process and generate responses based on new data. RAG facilitates periodic data updates without the need for fine-tuning, thereby streamlining the integration of LLMs into businesses.
The Enterprise RAG Solution Accelerator (GPT-RAG) offers a robust architecture tailored for enterprise-grade deployment of the RAG pattern. It ensures grounded responses and is built on Zero-trust security and Responsible AI, ensuring availability, scalability, and auditability. Ideal for organizations transitioning from exploration and PoC stages to full-scale production and MVPs. </td>

        <td>https://github.com/MSUSAzureAccelerators/Knowledge-Mining-with-OpenAI. The purpose of this repo is to accelerate the deployment of a Python-based Knowledge Mining solution with OpenAI that will ingest a Knowledge Base, generate embeddings using the contents extracted, store them in a vector search engine (Cognitive Search), and use that engine to answer queries / questions specific to that Knowledge Base.
        The Cognitive Search component serves to make it easier to ingest a Knowledge Base with a variety of document formats. The Cognitive Services component connected to the Search makes it possible to have an enrichment pipeline. This pipeline can generate information based on images for example, which can be included at the time of generating embeddings.
        This repo also includes a guide to build a Power Virtual Agent bot that could be used and adapted to connect to this solution, to create an end-to-end Knowledge Base Chatbot. /</td>

This project is designed as a Proof of Concept (PoC) to explore the innovative realm of generative AI within the context of multi-agent architectures. By leveraging Java and Microsoft Semantic Kernel AI orchestration framework, our aim is to build a chat web app to demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of using generative AI agents to transform user experience from web clicks to natural language conversations while maximizing reuse of the existing workload data and APIs. /</td>
